# RNA-seq-Analysis-of-Control-and-NRDE2-depleted-Breast-Cancer-Cells
Performed a differential gene expression analysis with RNA-seq that compares the expression in human control breast cancer cell lines with lines treated by silencing the NRDE2 gene. A Salmon + tximport + DESeq2 workflow was conducted to pursue this.
